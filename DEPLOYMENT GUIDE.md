Hello there, thanks for helping us deploy our web application.

This is a **Django** project.

kindly install our project's dependencies, found in the **requirements.txt** file.

Please, take note of the following:

**The rest password feature and Google Authentication for user sign-in need server details to work well.**

All other features work well.
