# How to  download images on python(django)
My task on this involved researching on how to download the favicons(images), after the user uploaded whatever images, text or texticons, he/she wants to use.
My team agreed on using python, django to be presice. so after the research, I created the project and app in a virtualenv and updated the appropriate files to effect the download function. There's also a requirement.txt.

# Implementation of Forgotten password page
This involved creating the forgotten password page, for the user, so that he/she can be able to recover his/her password through a recovery link, sent to the user's email.
I effected the media querry for desktop, tablet and mobile.

# Implementation of user authentication for forgotten Password
This involves giving the user the access(ability) to log back into our web app, if they forget their password. They do this by asking for a recovery email by inputting the email they registered with. Once the email is sent, a password reset link will be found there. Which will then be used following the instructions to get a new password and the user is in.
This was built with django authentication framework.
