This file contains a list and description: of all my tasks/ contributions to Team 64 in the Favicon Gen Project, alongside relevant links.

#### TASK 1

**Task:**

Team Lead

**Description:**

I volunteered and was chosen to lead the team in all its activities towards the completion of the project assigned to us. To this end, I have hosted the group meetings, assigned and followed up on tasks, amongst other duties.

At the beginning of the project phase, I created a Google form for team member's information (full name, track, phone number and email address). I also created a Google Doc and granted access to team members via email. This Google Doc has been used to document key points and ideas discussed during our meetings. It has served as a reference note, especially for persons who missed one meeting or the other. My team member, Bamidele Aminat Olanike a.k.a. Olanike(UI/UX) on Slack, volunteered and was assigned to update this Doc regularly. I have also edited this Doc occassionally following comment suggestions from other team members.
The phone numbers have been useful in contacting team members when they are needed but are offline on Slack.

Also, upon being added to the Zuri Organization on GitHub, I created the team's repository. I also coordinated the activities of the first presentation and subsequent submission of files to Zuri.

I have worked alongside the assistant team leads Great Okafor @Thelordgreat and David Adebola Adetoro @Bola001 .

#### TASK 2

**Task:**

How to upload images using Django

**Description:**

This was a research to find out how images can be uploaded to our Web Application using Django. To do this I scoured the web and came up with a solution that solved our needs. Our needs included having an image upload box that accepts both image upload and drag & drop, as well as displays a preview of the upload image.

I used the ImageField in Django models to implement this. The ImageField restricts user uploads to only valid image files. This task also required the installation of Pillow in my virtual environment to enable image upload by users. The upload images are set to save into a media/images directory in the database. Afer upload, a preview of the uploaded images appears. This was achieved using Django TemplateView and DetailView.
