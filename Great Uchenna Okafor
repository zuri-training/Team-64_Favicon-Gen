This file contains a list and description: of all my tasks/ contributions to Team 64 in the Favicon Gen Project.

TASK 1
Task:

Assistant Team Lead

Description:

I was chosen as the assistant team lead (for developers) for my team, of which as part of my duties I have hosted the group meetings, assigned and followed up on tasks, amongst other duties.

At the beginning of the project while we waited for designers to work on the necessary pages, i assigned research tasks to all developers on the team on some backend functionalities, myself inclusive. I researched on APIs for file conversion. But later decided we implement the codes for backend ourselves

I have worked alongside the general team leads Serah Nwoke @SerahN and David Adebola Adetoro @Bola001.



TASK 2
Task:

Implement Landing Page

Description:

I implemented the landing page (frontend) for our webapp following the design created by the designers on the team and made responsive on all screen sizes.



TASK 3
Task:

Master Merger (Merge branches in the repository after review)

Description:

This task involves reviewing the codes pushed by the collaborators (developers) on the team and merging them appropriately. The repository comprises of three classes of branches: main, dev (frontend and Backend) and feature/topic branches. Collaborators create feature branches which are merged by myself and my fellow master merger @SerahN into the corresponding dev branch, and ultimately into the main branch.
