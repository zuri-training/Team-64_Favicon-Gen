                <h4>What is a Favicon?</h4>
                <p>Favicons are the small square images that are usually displayed before the URL in the address bar of a browser, in the browsing tabs, and next to the site name in a users list of bookmarks.It’s important to have a favicon for your website for brand recognition so that your users can easily identify your site in their browser tabs and bookmarks.</p>
                <div class="img-container"> <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/favicon example.png' %}" alt="" class="example1"></div>
                <p>
                    You might also find this decorative icons, called a favorite icon or favicon for short, in your browser's favorites list or displayed on tabs. While not a requirement for any web site, favicons do add an extra touch of personalization that allow you to help brand your site and differentiate it from others. Favicon images are small in size, only 16 pixels in height by 16 pixels in width, so there is not much space for complex designs. Still, a good favicon that is clean, simple and easily identifiable can provide a good visual indicator for visitors navigating to your site through their tabs or bookmarks.

                    <br>
                    Favicon, short for “favourite icon”, was originally a new feature within Internet Explorer browser in 1999. When users bookmarked a site through Internet Explorer, they displayed the icon next to the website’s name in the favourites list.
                </p>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <div class="img-subcontainer1">
                        <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/favicon example 2.png' %}" alt="" class="example2"> 
                    </div>                    
                    <div class="img-subcontainer2">
                        <img src="{% static 'img/tutorial/amazon favicon.png' %}" alt="" class="amazon">     
                    </div>
                    
                </div>
                <p>Favicon can also be referred to as; browser icon, favorite icon, shortcut icon, tab icon, URL icon, and bookmark icon. The word favicon is short for “favorite icon” and originates from Internet Explorer’s “Favorites” feature which most modern browsers call “bookmarks”.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="formats">
                <h4> What are common favicon file formats?</h4>
                <h4>PNG - favicon.png</h4>
                <p>The PNG format is a nice format as it is a format to which most people are accustomed and which does not require special tools to create. With modern displays being high resolution the original problem of small icon dimensions for small resolutions does not exist anymore.The downside of the PNG format is that it is not compatible with IE5 per IE10.</p>
                <h4>ICO - favicon.ico</h4>
                <p>The ICO file format was developed by Microsoft and is the original file format for the favicon. The format is distinct because it allows for multiple small images within the same file. Usually since the little symbols required for a favicon in ICO arrange (16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels) can be scaled and optimized autonomously. At little measurements you can’t depend on the browser to naturally resize your symbol in an ideal way. The ICO format is supported by all browsers and it’s the only format that IE5 through IE10 supports.</p>
                <h4>SVG - favicon.svg</h4>
                <p>The SVG organize has benefits over the PNG and ICO groups, but doesn’t have incredible browser back however. SVG records are exceptionally lightweight and they are boundlessly adaptable. This implies that picture quality is eminent without relinquishing stack times for overwhelming pictures. As it were Chrome, Firefox, and Musical drama back SVG arrange favicons.</p>

                <h4>Step 1: Create Your Image</h4>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To support consistent brand identity, many businesses simply use their company logo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To make it easier to edit, start with a 64 x 64 pixel square and you can scale it down to 16 x 16 pixels later. Then you need to save the file as a .jpg, .png, .gif, svg etc.
                </p>
                <h4>Step 2: Convert the Image</h4>
                <p>
                    Once you’re confortable with the image you created, it needs to be saved as favicon.ico. This is the recommended format supported by most web browsers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To convert your file to the .ico format, you may need to use an online tool such as iconifier.net, prodraw.net, cloudconvert.com or faviconer.com.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Simply upload your image, select the icon size, and you can then download your brand new .ico file.
                </p>

                </p>
                <h4>Step 4: Add Basic HTML Code</h4>

                </p>
                <div class="link"><p> &lt;link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="http://example.com/favicon.ico" &gt; </p></div>
